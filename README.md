# NaughtyKeyboard

The Big List of Naughty Strings is a list of strings which have a high probability of causing issues when used as user-input data. This is a keyboard to help you test your app from your iOS device.

[minimaxir](https://github.com/minimaxir) put together a [list of strings](https://github.com/minimaxir/big-list-of-naughty-strings) that can harm your application. I put together 
a very simple iOS app that gives you access to a custom keyboard to use these strings to test your application.

## Instructions 

Clone the app, run it from Xcode then activate the Keyboard. Pretty Sure Apple wouldn't let me put that on the store.

## Disclaimer (again) 

The Big List of Naughty Strings (and this keyboard) is intended to be used for software you own and manage. Some of the Naughty Strings can indicate security vulnerabilies, and as a result using such strings with third-party software may be a crime. The maintainer is not responsible for any negative actions that result from the use of the list.
