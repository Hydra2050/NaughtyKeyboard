**[The Big List of Naughty Strings](https://github.com/minimaxir/big-list-of-naughty-strings)** is a list of strings which have a high probability of causing issues when used as user-input data.

I have put together these strings to create **Naughty Keyboard** – a very simple iOS app that gives you access to a custom keyboard to use these strings to test your application.

## Instructions 

Clone the app, run it from Xcode then activate the keyboard.
*I'm pretty sure Apple wouldn't allow me to put this on the App Store.*

## Disclaimer

The **Big List of Naughty Strings** (and this keyboard) is intended to be used for software you own and manage. Some of the *Naughty Strings* can indicate security vulnerabilies, and as a result using such strings with third-party software may be a crime.
